8 years ago in 2016, Andreas Antonopoulos once described his Bitcoin learning journey: 

>It’s a never ending journey of discovery. You scratch the surface, you find a layer; you dig, you find another layer; you go deeper, you find another layer that opens up new opportunities and possibilities; you start experimenting with those, you open up another layer. And while I’m doing that, Bitcoin itself is evolving. Bitcoin today is not Bitcoin of 2009. It’s growing, it’s evolving, it’s developing new capabilities and features. And so I’m absorbing as much information as possible but the information itself is growing at the same time. So while I know a lot about Bitcoin, I will never know everything about Bitcoin.
