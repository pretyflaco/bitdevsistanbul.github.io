8 years ago in 2016, Andreas Antonopoulos once described his Bitcoin learning journey: "It’s a never ending journey of discovery. You scratch the surface, you find a layer; you dig, you find another layer; you go deeper, you find another layer that opens up new opportunities and possibilities; you start experimenting with those, you open up another layer. And while I’m doing that, Bitcoin itself is evolving. Bitcoin today is not Bitcoin of 2009. It’s growing, it’s evolving, it’s developing new capabilities and features. And so I’m absorbing as much information as possible but the information itself is growing at the same time. So while I know a lot about Bitcoin, I will never know everything about Bitcoin."

8 years later, at the end of July 2024, former US president Donald Trump and presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy spoke at a Bitcoin conference. It was part of their campaigns running for the highest office in the USA. Both of them made big election promises in hopes they would win votes from people who like Bitcoin. 

But what is good Bitcoin policy and how is it created? Can politicians really take the appropriate time out of their busy schedules to develop the necessary understanding to regulate this emerging technology like Antonopoulos did? Presidential candidates don’t make policy on their own, of course. They have big teams of research assistants who advise them. The same is true not just for presidents, but other political representatives as well, like members of the House of Representatives and the Senate. These, too, have teams of researchers who need to be proficient in order to advise and devise sensible policy.
